Q: How does God deal out judgement?

Aquinis:
Here we should remark that zeal, properly speaking, signifies an **intensity of love**, whereby the one who loves intensely does not tolerate anything which is repugnant to his love.

“Good zeal is a fervor of spirit, by which, scorning the fear of death, one is on fire for the defense of the truth. He is consumed by it who takes steps to correct any perversity he sees; and if he cannot, he tolerates it with sadness.”

Q: Do you have zeal?
Q: What is an example of *zeal*?
Q: What must the disciples have thought?
