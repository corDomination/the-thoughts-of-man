26:1-11: (stop): What did Paul do to Christians besides killing them?
26: 22: "But I have enjoyed God’s help to this very day, and so I stand here testifying to small and great alike, saying nothing different from what the prophets and Moses foretold,[f] 23 that the Messiah must suffer[g] and that, as the first to rise from the dead, he would proclaim light both to our people and to the Gentiles.”

What inspires you about Paul?

26:24-32
The king knows about these matters and to him I speak boldly, for I cannot believe that [any] of this has escaped his notice; this was not done in a corner.
Meaning: for Luke, this Greek proverb expresses his belief that he is presenting a story about Jesus and the church that is already well known. As such, the entire history of Christianity is public knowledge and incontestable.

Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?

There are seven times in Scripture when God calls the name of a person twice. 
Abraham, Abraham! 
Jacob, Jacob!
Moses, Moses! 
Samuel, Samuel! 
Martha, Martha! 
Simon, Simon! 
Saul, Saul!
