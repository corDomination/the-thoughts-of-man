# The Fine Clothes
### Sin of Partiality
The book of James
- Who does James say that he is? 
- James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in the dispersion, greetings.

James 1:1-3: Beginning of Book of James
- **Consider it all joy, my brothers, when you encounter various trials,** for you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance.

James 2: 1-13: The Sin of Partiality

- What comes to mind when you hear "The sin of partiality"?

- Q: When are you partial?
- Whom should we be partial to?
- "Have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil designs?"
- Q: What are we to do in these situations?
- Why are we partial?
- What can allow us to not be partial?

Opressing the poor, the dirty, the needy is to blaspheme the name of Jesus.

What makes it hard to this?

James 2: 14-26
### Faith and Works

What does a faith without works look like?
How do we have this ideal faith life where
**Faith -> translates to and is inseparable from -> works**?

One of the classic mistakes, that I have seen, is to desire works to prove ones faith. We want works to be a natural fruit of faith.
What are works?
- Serving of ALL (beatitudes/ love your neighbor as yourself)
- Loving in a just and caring way
- Working faithfully for "the greater glory of God"
  - As artists, musicians, athletes, employees, we do work that can be an act of faith.
- Is living a life of faith and works difficult?
- What do you find most difficult?
