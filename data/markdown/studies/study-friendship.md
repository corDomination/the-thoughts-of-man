# Friendship

Luke 8: The word hear occurs 8 times within 20 verses.
Luke 8:4 - "Whoever has ears ought to hear".
Mark 4:9 - "Whoever has ears to hear ought to hear."
Matthew 11:15 - "Whoever has ears ought to hear."
- What Christ seems to be saying is that this good news, this truth, it needs to be heard by all. And this has two different angles
1. 1/2 of hearing is the speaker, sharing what they have to say
   1. We are to be speakers for Christ, or perhaps like amps (amplifiers) used in music. We are not playing a new song, but we are helping that song be heard everywhere.
2. The other 1/2 of hearing is the listener, and Jesus calls us here to listen and listen well to him.

What do you do when someone is talking with you? What is the loving thing to do?

Jesus’ Betrayal and Arrest - Matthew 20:47-50

From PS 133: How good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity!

John 15:11-17:
How does Jesus' image of love for friends apply to how you love friends.

To quote St Thomas 
- Christ did not lay down his life for us his enemies as we remain his enemies, but that he might make us his friends. That is to say, even if we were not friends as those loving him, nonetheless we were his friends as loved by him.

How can we translate this to prayer.

- What do you think about when you are going to hang out with a friend?
- Do you intitiate time with others? Are you a no-asker?
- Who do you enjoy spending time with most?
- Who loves you best?
- What can you learn from them?
- Do you make consisten effort to see friends?
- As part of initiating, do we plan activities hangouts?

Big takeaway:
Listening is loving, and we are asked to hear.
Listening is a choice, and we ought to listen to Christ.
When we pray, we may ask for things, we may pray about people, but do we apply these ideas of friendship to our prayer life.
