St. Thomas Aquinas
- There are two sides to every sin, the turning toward transient satisfaction and the turning away from everlasting good. As regards the turning-toward, the principle of all sins is cupidity in its most general sense, namely, the unbridled desire for ones own pleasure. As regards the turning-away, the principle is pride in its general sense, which is lack of submission to God: the beginning of pride is mans revolt from God (Ecclus. 10:14). Cupidity and pride in this pervasive sense are not called capital sins, because as such they are not special sins: they are the roots and sprouts of vice, as the desire for happiness is the root of all virtue. [7]

- Summa theologiae (ST), la-IIae, qu. 77, art. 4, corp. In his response to the third objection, St. Thomas expands on his answer: Man is said to love both the good he desires for himself, and himself to whom he desires it. Love, in so far as it is directed to the object of desire (e.g., a man is said to love wine or money) admits, as its cause, fear which pertains to the avoidance of evil: for every sin arises either from inordinate desire for some good, or from inordinate avoidance of some evil. But each of these is reduced to self-love, since it is through loving himself that man either desires good things or avoids evil things.
