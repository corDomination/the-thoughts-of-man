How have things been?
Redemption:
The word redemptio is the Latin Vulgate rendering of the Hebrew KPR and Greek lutron which, in the Old Testament, means generally a ransom-price.

Paul and the acts of the apostles, with a focus on the redemption arc

The first mention of Paul is when Stephen is being martyred

Paul has just consented to the killing of Stephen when we get to Acts 8:3

[Acts 8: Persecution of the Church](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%208&version=NABRE)
Acts 8:3 Saul…was trying to destroy the church: like Stephen, Saul was able to perceive that the Christian movement contained the seeds of doctrinal divergence from Judaism. A pupil of Gamaliel, according to Acts 22:3, and totally dedicated to the law as the way of salvation (Gal 1:13–14), Saul accepted the task of crushing the Christian movement, at least insofar as it detracted from the importance of the temple and the law. His vehement opposition to Christianity reveals how difficult it was for a Jew of his time to accept a messianism that differed so greatly from the general expectation.

Can we be redeemed?
Can others be redeemed?
