# Romans 15
Paul looks at his fellow men, those who are leading the church in Rome and says "I am convinced that you are...

- "full of goodness"
- "filled with all knowledge"
- "able to admonish one another"
 
Acknoledging God who enables our success.

15:20 - I aspire to proclaim the gospel not where Christ has already been named, so that I do not build on another's foundation, but as it is written "Those who have never been told of him shall see, and those who have never heard of him shall understand"

Isiah 52:15, quoted above

A case of the knowledge of the messiah, the joy and the news of this, must be shared.
