### Establishing what they are
What are riches?

[Catechsism: 2401-2405](http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s2c2a7.htm)

Focus on 2404 Q: What are your thoughts on this line in particular? 

Is this how you view what you own?

[Remember the Lord Your God: Deut. 8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%208&version=ESV)

Q (10-14): 

Why would life/riches/wealth/comfort possibly make us forget God?

### What did Jesus have to say about wealth
[Luke 16:19-31](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2016%3A19-31&version=NABRE)

Q: What stands out to you about the fact that he is a rich man?

What request does the rich man make of God?

Why does God reject it?

Why does this rich man feel entitled to ask in this way? (perhaps it is a symptom of riches and comfort, and being used to getting what you ask for)
