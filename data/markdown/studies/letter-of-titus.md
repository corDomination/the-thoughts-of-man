# Letter of Titus

## Titus 1:
"to Titus, my true child in our common faith"

What is the Christian Life?

A man be...
-blameless
- married only once
- with believing children who are not accused of licentiousness or rebellious

A bishop as God's steward must be...
- blameless
- not arrogant
- not irritable
- not a drunkard
- not aggressive
- not greedy for sordid gain
- hospitable
- a lover of goodness
- temperate
- just
- holy
- self-controlled


Q: Who is Titus writing to?
Q: Who is Paul teaching Titus to reach out to?

"They claim to know God, but by their deeds they deny him."

Q: How can we "know" God?
## Titus 2:
older men should be
- temperate
- dignified
- self-controlled
- sound in faith
- sound in love
- sound in endurance

Temperate - showing moderation or self-restraint

2:13 - "As we await the blessed hope, the coming of our savior Jesus Christ."
Said as part of the Our Father prayer

# Titus 3:
"Advice to Titus. I want you to insist on these points, that those who have believed in God be careful to devote themselves to good works; these are excellent and beneficial to others. Avoid foolish arguments, genealogies, rivalries, and quarrels about the law, for they are useless and futile. After a first and second warning, break off contact with a heretic, realizing that such a person is perverted and sinful and stands self-condemned."

### The phrase "Man of Prayer" has been stuck in my mind lately and is a term I think we all should strive to adopt.
