# The Final Parable of the 7
The fig tree

Scripture:
- Luke 21:29-36
- Mark 13:28-37
- Matthew 24:32-44 

What a bold statement "My words will by no means pass away".

Before this: Apololyptic claims from Jesus. If looking at this in isolation, it seems confusing given our place in history.
We cannot know the day or the hour, we are not meant to be doomsday-preppers.

Q: How can Jesus make this claim? Certainly an example of his sureness of the truth of his words.

Constant readiness (Matthew 24:44)

Song I heard today that, when diving into the lyrics, really is the opposite of what we hear
- "And they say there's a heaven for those who will wait
Some say it's better, but I say it ain't
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
The sinners are much more fun"
