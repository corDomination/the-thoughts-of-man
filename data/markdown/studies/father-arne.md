# Father Arne

"And that is how evil operates: by putting obstacles between individuals and true community. His first weapon is lust. The sexual appetite is all-powerful, because it engenders a powerful good: the propagation of humanity itself. When the sexual appetite is turned to selfish self-indulgence, it destroys not only individuals, but a whole culture. When lust doesn’t work for the devil, or even if it does, he goes after charity. Once more: suspicion, vindictiveness, anger, and other such feelings are inimical to charity, because they divide people from one another. In all cases, I encourage spiritual jujitsu. When you begin to feel any of these divisive emotions, be self-aware, and immediately say a prayer for whoever is the object of your anger or resentment. This sets your spiritual house in order, and keeps you closer to community, and less scattered."

Proverbs 16:1-12

Always practical, for these troubled D.C. souls, Father Arne offered the simplest kind of spiritual direction. Morning offering on your knees. Morning prayer, talking to God as father. The same in the afternoon. Pray to your guardian angel. Daily mass if you can. End the day with three Aves for purity, and an examination of conscience.

Toward the end, word went around that Father Arne was failing and that he was still seeing anyone who came to the door. And those who peeked in upon his deathbed came away profoundly moved by a man who never gave up his apostolic mission. He told Mary, “So, in my case, I’m at death’s door [laughs], and I’m having some of the best moments of my life. What can I say?”
