## Holy Hour
The Holy Hour tradition officially goes back to 1674 when Christ appeared to St. Margaret Mary Alacoque multiple times over a 13 month period. Christ’s appearances to this saint emphasized his human heart – how he loves as both human and divine. Christ instructed Alacoque to spend an hour every Thursday evening meditating on His sufferings in the Garden of Gethsemane.

I am deeply grieved, even to death; remain here, and stay awake with me.

Matthew 26:36
In the Gospel of Matthew, we learn that Jesus and his disciples went to Gethsemane after the Last Supper. He shared his suffering and grief with them, knowing of His crucifixion the next day. So, Jesus went to pray, but He asked His disciples to stay awake with Him. When he returned, however, He found the disciples asleep. “So, could you not stay awake with me one hour?” (Mt 26:40).

When we make a Holy Hour, we remain and stay awake with Jesus. It’s a powerful and beautiful way to grow closer to Him. Holy Hours are commonly done in Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, but you could make a Holy Hour at any time: in a church, your home, or even outside in nature.
