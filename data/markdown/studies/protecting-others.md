Q: What are some of the gifts that we as men have?

Exercise and the gifts of being a man:

We believe as Catholics that we are each given specific skills/gifts/talents/leanings that we ought to use to honor God.

When someone gives you a gift, you honor them by receiving it well and caring for it.

We are to offer our bodies as a living sacrifice. A clear example of female sacrifice of their body is with children.

It is a natural outlet for them to give of themselves for another.

Q: Why do you exercise?

What are good reasons to exercise?

Equipping yourself for the tasks and emergencies life provides.

Protecting others: What ought to be protected? (purity, health, love, the vulnerable, our emotional closeness with women, those entrusted to us.)

1 Corinthians 6:19

Scripture: 1 Timothy 5

Killing and harming others are paradigmatic wrongs. And yet there is at least one intuitive exception to this prohibition narely, killing or harming in self-defense, or in defense of others. Consider Murder: The attacker is culpably trying to kill the Victim because he is jealous of the Victim's success. The victim can save his own life only by lethally throwing a grenade at the Attacker. With the exception of strict pacifists, there is broad consensus in morality and law that defensive harm can be permissible in cases like this.

"They will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors for my name's sake.

This will be your opportunity to bear witness.

- You will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends,

and some of you they will be put to death. You will be hated by all for my name's sake.

But not a hair of your head will perish. By your endurance, you will gain your lives." (Luke 21:12-13, 16-19)

"Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell." (Matthew 10:28)

"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also."

"Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,

so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven.

For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust." (Matthew 5:44-45)

Does defending oneself change if it's just you vs many others?
