[LOL, why does this exist???](https://jobs.togethersc.org/career/pope) 

Q: What do you do when you dislike your boss?

Q: How should we treat the Pope?
Q: How about other leaders?

Q: Is how you think of others desiring their growth in love and faith, or is it merely gossip?

Discuss Jesus praying for Peter as the leader
