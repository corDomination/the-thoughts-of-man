# Discourse on Love

What was something your parents said or did out of love that has stuck with you?

When your parent tells you not to text and drive, or tells you to get good grade

- To understand love, we most likely can all pull from our experience with family, more specifically parents.
- For to understand how to Love well we must understand what that looks like, and more importantly we must understand that we already receive it

For God/Christ, we are sheep, and he the shepherd. He loves us, in spite of our failings, in spite of our desire to wander and let others lead us astray.

- This is rather akin to how a parent will love a young child. They love that child in spite of the late nights, the many diapers, the lack of an instinct of self preservation.

To cite my article on **Relationships**,
"One of the things parents often do (and that my mom did do), is put up restrictions to different aspects of their children's dating relationship for the good of their child."

The Way of Love: [1 Corinthians 13](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/1corinthians/13)

Love: 1-8: "If I give away everything I own, and if I hand my body over so that I may boast but do not have love, I gain nothing."

- Why should we love?
- How should we love?

When I was a child, I used to talk as a child, think as a child, reason as a child; when I became a man, I put aside childish things.

- How has your idea of love changed from when you were a child to now?
- What is a child's view of love?
- What is a man's view of love?

The themes of Faith, Hope and Love became known as the Virtutes Theologicae, or Theological Virtues.

Jesus' Commandment: [John 15:12-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2015%3A12-17&version=NABRE)

- You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit.
- We have been loved first, "chosen".

Self-love / Feeling of love, what modern society focuses on is not what Love is.

**Divine-love = love of divine** - This is what we are called to. Love God first, then all else will fall into place
