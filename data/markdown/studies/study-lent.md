40 days - This motif is seen both in Exodus 24:18 (Moses on the mountain) and 1 Kings 19:8 (Elijah on his journey to Horeb)

The question that should be asked before any of this is, who am I doing this for? Am I seeking an earthly reward as my aim?
In all of your interactions, but especially in your service, think back to Matthew 6, for it should challenge you to your core.

Do you pray in silence, alone, where no one will know?
Do you help people and not seek recognition?
Do you use your generosity and kindness as a token to improve your image?

Ask these questions regularly.

The realization that comes from Matthew 6 is that the most saintly, virtuous people, may go unnoticed by the world and by you.
