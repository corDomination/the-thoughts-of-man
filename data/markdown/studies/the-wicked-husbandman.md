# The Wicked Husbandman/Tenants
The 6th of the 7 synoptic parables (parables that occur in both Mark, Matthew, and Luke)

### Random Quote
- Most people have been taught to approach Bible study with the attitude of “how does this apply to me?”, or “what can I get out of this?”  This method uses God’s word to support and validate belief systems. Rather than a desire to know what God wants, many “believers” are using God’s word and appropriating scripture to support certain agendas.

Prior to this parable: 
- Jesus had entered Jerusalem.
- He had just driven out the moneychangers and salesmen in the temple.
- He also has been previously questioned by Pharisee's as to his authority.

## Parable 6
The Wicked Husbandman
- Luke 20:9-19
- Mark 12:1-12
- Matthew 21:33-45

Q: How can we understand the actions of the tenants/workers?
Q: Why did they kill the vineyard owners son?

Q: Have you not...?
Jesus is challenging the Pharisees, an example of where because of their knowledge of scripture, they **ought** to know who he is, and who they are.

Jesus was addressing the Sanhedrin, and that they were to blame.

- [Psalm 118](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20118&version=NABRE)

Jesus was well read with the Psalms as a Jewish man. 

In danger I called on the Lord;
    the Lord answered me and set me free.
6 The Lord is with me; I am not afraid;
    what can mortals do against me?

Blessed is he
    who comes in the name of the Lord.
We bless you from the house of the Lord.
27     The Lord is God and has enlightened us.
Join in procession with leafy branches
    up to the horns of the altar.


Q: What do verses 26-27 make you think of?
