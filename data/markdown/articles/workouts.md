## Fitness

One of the greatest gifts you can give to your future self and loved ones is taking care of your body, so that you can be healthy and active with them long into the future.

### Different routines for different goals 
When training for running, I reccomend:
- 2 days of hard cardio
- 3-4 days of easy/medium cardio
- 1-2 days of bodyweight

When training for overall fitness, I reccomend:
- 1 day of hard cardio
- 1-2 days of easy cardio
- 3 days of bodweight

When training for strength, I reccomend:
- 1-2 days of easy cardio
- 4 days of bodyweight

At different points in my life, each of these routines has been tried with successful results.

My training philosophy:

Maintain all systems, both strength and endurance wise, to make myself be fit, strong, and ready for whatever life throws at me. 


These workouts are intended to be done with 0-15 seconds of rest between reps and
            sets. Between each section take 1-2 minutes of rest. To get the full benefit of these workouts, good sleep,
            hydration, and nutrition are needed.
