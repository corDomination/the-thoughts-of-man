When growing the relationship, try to make sure that the...
* emotional
* spiritual
* physical
* temporal (time)
* social 

...intimacies all grow with each other.

Growing one far beyond the others creates an imbalance and in the long term, the relationship will need each of these to be strong in the long term.
When it comes to dating/marrying a spouse who does not share the same faith/beliefs as us, that relationship can work, but you have to remember 2 things.
1. That person is/may not be striving for heaven (and all of the virtues that we aim for due to this)
2. That person, if you have children, will spend the same if not more time with them and be extremly influential in the kind of people they grow up to be.

Good communication is the groundwork for all good relationships/friendships, and this is an essential part of making a relationship work long term. This is due to the fact that 
in any relationship, conflict, decisions, and disagreements will arise where healthy communication skills will be necessary to healthily navigate these times. Also, the thing you will do most with your girlfriend/spouse is talk with them,
so enjoying and feeling comfortable with that is vital.

One of the things parents often do (and that my mom did do), is put up restrictions to different aspects of their children's dating relationship for the good of the relationship.
I started dated Maddie in early highschool, and one of the things my mom did was limit how much time we spent with eachother per week and how much time we had totally alone together.
This was done out of a love, and to generalize this practice my mom implemented; It can be useful to restrict and curate how much and in what scenarios you interact with you signifcant other.

Something that Maddie and I did throughout dating was on most days, we had a short 10-30 minute call each night, just because we enjoyed hearing from one another, and to focus on our ability to communicate and listen well.
This massively helped us in the long run since we made it such an intentional habit early on.

When it comes to dating, we are aiming towards marriage.
Marriages do not require friendship, and can function (albeit not as well, without friendship).
However, I think it is generally accepted (and I have certainly found it the case) that friendship does enhance marriage and make it even fuller. I encourage you all to seek someone who one day you can call your wife and also 
your best friend.

Protect the beauty, the virtuous, the precious parts of the relationship and let go of the selfish, hedonistic, and damaging behaviors.

If you have a high standard for the person you are looking for, make sure to ask the question, am I taking the steps to being a man worthy of such a woman.

To bring this back to scripture,
Ephesians 5:25-29: Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her.

Serve and love the person you are with, and always be preparing yourself for the sacrifice we are called to.

If your parents modeled marriage well for you, then learn to imitate the best qualities of their marriage.
If your parents marriage was strained, broken, or toxic, then learn from the struggles they had and improve on what they did, giving your community and possible family an image of a healthy and virtuous love.
