### How do you find someone?
Ask 4 questions.

- What is your motivation to get into a relationship?
- What kind of person do I want?
- Where am I likely to find said person?
- How can I prepare myself to be a person they would be interested in?

### Are you meeting your own standards?
For those not in a relationship:
- If you have a high standard for the person you are looking for, make sure to ask the question, am I taking the steps to be worthy of such a person?
For those in a relationship:
- Do you call your spouse to greater virtue with how you carry yourself and how you love them?

### Balancing Intimacies
When growing the relationship, try to make sure that the...
* emotional
* physical
* spiritual
* temporal (time)
* social 
...intimacies all grow with each other.
Allowing one aspect to overshadow the others creates imbalance, impacting the relationship's long-term strength.

### Interfaith Relationships
Dating or marrying someone with different beliefs/morals is possible, but two important considerations arise:
1. The person may not share the same moral/spiritual/life goals, impacting virtues and aspirations.
2. If children are involved, the partner's influence on their upbringing is significant, requiring careful consideration.

### Communication is Key
The thing you will do most with your spouse/significant other is communicate, so enjoying and feeling comfortable with that is vital.
Good communication is the groundwork for all good relationships/friendships, and this is an essential part of making a relationship work long term.
This is due to the fact that in any relationship, conflict, decisions, and disagreements will arise where healthy communication skills will be necessary to healthily navigate these times. 

Something that my wife and I did throughout dating was on most days, we had a short 10-30 minute call each night, just because we enjoyed hearing from one another, and to focus on our ability to communicate and listen well.
This massively helped us in the long run since we made it such an intentional habit early on.

### Parental Protection
One of the things parents often do (and that my mom did do), is put up restrictions to different aspects of their children's dating relationship for the good of their child.
I started dating my wife in early highschool, and one of the things my mom did was limit how much time we spent with each other per week and how much time we had totally alone together.
This was done out of a love, and to generalize this practice my mom implemented; It can be useful to restrict and curate how much and in what scenarios you interact with you signifcant other. 
These restrictions, implemented out of love, provided a protective framework that contributed to our relationship's health.
Protect and nurture your relationship as a loving parent would for their child.
Protect the beauty, the virtuous, the precious parts of the relationship and let go of the selfish, hedonistic, obsessive, and damaging behaviors.

### Building a Communication Foundation
One of our intentional practices was establishing regular short calls during our dating phase. This simple habit significantly enhanced our ability to communicate and listen well, laying a strong foundation for the future.

### The Role of Friendship
When it comes to dating, we are aiming towards marriage.
Marriages do not require friendship, and can function (albeit not as well, without friendship).
However, I think it is generally accepted (and I have certainly found it the case) that friendship does enhance marriage and make it even fuller. I encourage you all to seek someone who one day you can call your wife and also 
your best friend.

#### Building a Friendship
- Quantity and quality time both matter.
- Listen attentively.
- Anticipate needs.
- Be intentional.
- Compliment their good/virtuous traits.
- Plan activites with them in mind.

### Embracing Sacrificial Love
Ephesians 5:25-29: Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her.
Serve and love the person you are with, and always be preparing yourself to sacrifice yourself for their sake.

### Learning from the Struggles of Others
If your parents modeled marriage well for you, then learn to imitate the best qualities of their marriage.
If your parents marriage was strained, broken, or toxic, then learn from the struggles they had and improve on what they did, giving your community and possible family an image of a healthy and virtuous love.
