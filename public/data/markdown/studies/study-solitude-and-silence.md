From a few weeks ago:
Jesus told His followers, “But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you” (Matthew 6:6, NIV).

[Mark 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+1&version=NABRE) Jesus Leaves Capernaum. 35 Rising very early before dawn, he left and went off to a deserted place, where he prayed. 36 Simon and those who were with him pursued him 37 and on finding him said, “Everyone is looking for you.” 38 He told them, “Let us go on to the nearby villages that I may preach there also. For this purpose have I come.” 39 So he went into their synagogues, preaching and driving out demons throughout the whole of Galilee.

Thomas à Kempis was a German-Dutch canon regular known for his work "The Imitation of Christ," a renowned devotional book emphasizing spiritual life and following the teachings of Christ.

He was tasked with instructing novices in how to lead a religious life, and he combined and added to these to create "The Imitation of Christ".

Do you pursue silence?

What does going off to a deserted place signify?

Fear of silence

"So, obviously, this type of avoidance can not be sustained indefinitely; therefore, without something to keep oneself preoccupied, the silence or lack of activity exposes the person’s discomfort with him or herself. This is the way of the modern, fast-paced, consumer-based, entertainment-laden world; however, it is not the way of faith, prayer, or contemplation. Rather, these latter three are the antidote to a life lived in a frenetic, automatic, unexamined way."
