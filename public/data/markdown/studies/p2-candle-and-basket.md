[Interesting Read on the History of the Gospels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Gospels)

Q: What are we?
- **You** are the light of the world.
- A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.
- Lamps are meant to be put out, not hidden

Q: What does being a city on a hill imply?

"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven."

"For there is nothing hidden which will not be revealed, nor has anything been kept secret but that it should come to light."

Q: What are some of the underlying themes?
- Be virtuous, do not hide your faith or your love. 
- Your good works may help others glorify God
- Integrity/Visibility: Nothing is hidden, so the weight of our sin and brokenness, even if not seen by others is still seen
  - If you are a "city on a hill", **all** of the good and bad you do will be seen.


John McEvilly writes that...
- "These words have the same object as the preceding, to stimulate the Apostles to shine as lights before the world, to enlighten the surrounding darkness, and impart to all the world the light of a holy, spotless life, and of pure teaching. As a city on a hill cannot be hid, so neither can the Apostles, from their exalted position, be concealed from the eyes of men; and, hence, their duty, to live so as to edify men. As no one lights a candle for the purpose of concealing its light, so neither did God constitute the Apostles as the lights of the world, in order to hide their light and detain the truth of God in injustice. Their duty is quite plain, viz., to diffuse this light far and near; to be deterred by no obstacles, in the free exercise of the exalted commission confided to them by God Himself, and to show forth the brilliancy of their virtues, and by their example to allure others to God."
